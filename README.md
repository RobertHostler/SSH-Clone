# SSH-Clone
I have used the simple TCP server and client I wrote previously to create a simplified clone of the SSH tool.
Once users of the client script log in, they can run a bash command that is then sent to the server and
executed there.
This is obviously not meant to be a serious alternative to SSH; I did it for fun and for educational purposes.
If you want to try it for yourself, the username is 'admin' and the password is 'password'.
